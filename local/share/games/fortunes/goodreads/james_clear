“The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If youâre proud of how your hair looks, youâll develop all sorts of habits to care for and maintain it. If youâre proud of the size of your biceps, youâll make sure you never skip an upper-body workout. If youâre proud of the scarves you knit, youâll be more likely to spend hours knitting each week. Once your pride gets involved, youâll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits.”
